      <p>
        We often encounter someone who is designing an event, and for them,
        design consists of table centerpieces and an entry arch. Or a few gobo
        projections on the wall. Or linens and chair covers.
      </p>

      <p>
        While all of these things may enter the purview of the event designer,
        they really aren’t “design” by themselves; they are elements of design.
        How do these elements interact with each other, how are they composed in
        the space, and how will this composition impact the guest’s experience?
      </p>

      <p>
        Good spatial composition not only allows for practical concerns like
        crowd flow or sightlines, it helps set the tone for the attendee’s
        comfort, their experiential understanding of the event’s messaging and
        theme, and so much more. With this said, you can’t just think “floor
        plan” and be thrilled that you squeezed all the tables in. You need to
        be able to compose in all three dimensions.
      </p>

      <h2>Framing, Leading Lines, and The Rule of Thirds</h2>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever taken an art class, you’re probably familiar with these
        concepts. Jog your memory, because they matter a lot in event design.
        Here’s a refresher:
      </p>

      <p>
        “Framing” is the method in which subject matter is presented with a
        surrounding element that draws attention to that subject. This can be
        large or small, the whole picture or small elements of it, like the way
        guest seating might surround the dance floor, or a proscenium might
        surround the stage.
      </p>

      <h2>Symmetric or Asymmetric</h2>
      <p>
        When choosing one of these general approaches, there is no absolute
        right or wrong in event design. But, you need to know which way you’re
        taking your event, and apply your strategy consistently. With asymmetry,
        there are many more ways a composition can go wrong.
      </p>

      <h2>Balance the Elements</h2>
      <p>
        While it should seem like an obvious concept, it’s surprising how many
        people miss this one. Balance, don’t clump. And if you do, make lots of
        clumps and spread them around fairly evenly. Fill spaces, but leave
        margins so the space doesn’t feel bloated. Move away from the walls a
        bit, because walls are part of the composition too.
      </p>

      <h2>Massing and Weight</h2>
      <p>
        Where possible, keep the heavy colors, materials, and big scenic
        elements toward the bottom of the picture, with elements becoming
        lighter and smaller as you reach upward. This keeps the scene from
        feeling oppressive and over-heavy. We are challenged in lighting by
        requests for busy pattern projections on the ceiling….it can really make
        it feel like the roof is caving in if we don’t compose carefully. We
        lean towards lighter, theme-specific treatments overhead if at all
        possible, but when we can’t, we really have to amp up the eye-level
        lighting to keep the massing lower.
      </p>

      <h2>Respect the Space</h2>
      <p>
        If you must bury your ornate ballroom in walls of drape, fine. I’ll
        assume the more plain venues were already booked, and your client is not
        a classicist. But if not, and the space’s architecture isn’t going to
        squabble with your theme and colors, then make your design work with the
        architecture, not against it. Don’t dress a 25’ tall column with a 12’
        tall drape panel. The same goes for lighting. Why not make your
        projections fit the architecture? Every space has a compositional rhythm
        of its own, and it will enlighten your event to let this rhythm call at
        least some of the shots.
      </p>

      <h2>Blending Opposites</h2>
      <p>
        For most, this is a difficult trick. But, if handled well, you can make
        a centerpiece out of old phones, stuffed ponies, and miniature coffee
        cups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone has a different approach to blending disparate design concepts
        into a palatable and effective presentation. For me, it’s about
        remembering that you are telling a visual story….and you are telling it
        to people who may be drinking, or at the very least are concerned about
        spilling soup onto their evening wear. In other words, you may not have
        their undivided attention. Thus, bigger counts. If you’re going to
        present it, own it. Over and over and over. Don’t be afraid to repeat a
        point in the story.
      </p>

      <h2>Distract to Conceal</h2>
      <p>
        Love the venue but hate the wallpaper? This is where the old “hey, look
        over here” magician’s trick comes in handy. For lighting folks, when
        asked “I hate this carpet, can you do something to it?” we say “Yes.
        Let’s light something you like instead.” Lead the viewer’s attention
        where you want it.
      </p>

      <h2>Color Choice and Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Really, any discussion of event coloring is it’s own discussion by
        itself, however a monochromatic color scheme may make your theme easier
        to execute, but it will completely eliminate the reason you chose the
        color in the first place by bombarding your guests with so much of it
        that their brains stop processing it as that color. So, pick a
        secondary, complimentary accent tone (no, grey and black are not
        colors). Use the above rules to work the secondary color into the
        design, and you’ll be fine!
      </p>

      <p>
        Event lighting is a crucial part of the design in a space, it attributes
        to the feeling, emotion and tone you experience when you enter a space.
        The best moments we manifest with lighting are the ones where all of the
        elements and materials are seamlessly blended together and composed
        using many or all of these strategies.
