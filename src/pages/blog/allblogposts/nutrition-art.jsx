        Dining involves more than just a tongue-teasing dish. Eyes, ears, noses
        and skin can all be involved to augment a culinary experience, as
        numerous scientific studies have found, tableware is one medium through
        which to do it. Indeed scientists have found that changing the shape,
        colour and weight of plates, glasses and cutlery can all influence the
        perception of a meal. And designers have taken note.

      <h2>Quality</h2>
      <p>
        As recently as 15 years ago the idea that you could grab a nutritious,
        healthy and still tasty meal from a drive-thru or fast food restaurant
        was unheard of. It wasn’t until the post Y2K era that fast food
        consumers became concerned with what they ate. As the Millennial
        generation started spending money on food outside the home the industry
        has been “forced” to move toward healthier, high-quality menu
        alternatives. Once begun this movement toward fresher, greener menus has
        continued to accelerate at an ever increased pace.
