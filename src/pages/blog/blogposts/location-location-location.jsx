        It’s not all about the venue, attendees are looking to the destination
        as a whole to provide unique offerings.
      </p>

      <p>
        A destination must appeal and complement the event, particularly as a
        lot of time is spent in hotels, networking or with scheduled free time.
        You don’t want the event to fall flat because attendees are holed up in
        a motel, miles away from activities when they break for the day, so
        choosing a destination that opens up further opportunities is important.
        We look at the meetings and events industry trends influencing event
        destinations as well what they can do to prepare themselves for event
        planners. Make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do
        things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too
        hesitant to attempt. But once you become accustomed to such a life you
        will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty.

      <h2>Destination Playgrounds</h2>
      <p>
        Add fun and adventure to corporate events by turning the destination
        into a playground to enjoy and use. This involves play across the city
        creating an atmosphere as well as activity planning. Seasonal events are
        an excellent example of how cities can unify through themes and this
        becomes a creative starting point for event planners. Winter
        wonderlands, summer fayres or local events can set the tone for the
        venue and extend the event theme into the city as if all were
        participants.
      </p>

      <h2>City Immersion</h2>
      <p>
        With more time spent on leisure than business during a work trip, it
        means that traveling attendees need to be reached outside the venue and
        we are looking to destinations to offer an immersive experiences to
        extend the event floor and message. Oversized Art is another form in
        which this trend is coming to fruition is through the recreation of city
        murals. Installing large custom pieces of artwork for photo
        opportunities is more exciting to guests than the standard photo booth.
        Something to keep in mind is that the larger the destination city, the
        more room for interactive oversized art. There is more opportunity to
        pull inspiration, more ways to educate the attendees via art, and a
        larger platform with which to show off the destination.

      <p>
        Some destinations are inevitably linked in our minds with certain
        concepts, sometimes prejudging a location. It requires the effort of
        many players, from local authorities to small business owners. Focus on
        the finer details of a destination, whether that’s the experiences,
        wildlife, local cuisine or culture and capitalize on that by showing a
        new side to the destination that blows away expectations. Destinations
        that have previously been known to appeal to one demographic are
        starting to consider their offerings in other markets. Make a change and
        surprise attendees by overcoming the odds working against the
        destination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Authentic connections help make a destination sink in and lessons
        learned, attendees form that bond and look deeper to discover all the
        location or city has to offer. Creating that connection could be done
        through something as simple as bringing puppies into an internal
        meeting. The thought itself is exciting, and it is actually a useful
        tactic to make an otherwise standard business meeting a memorable and
        positive experience for the group. Plus, by partnering with a local
        animal shelter in order to bring the puppies into the meeting, the group
        forms a deeper connection with the destination. The idea of joining
        forces helps with event destinations providing packages and bids that
        supersede the greater competition. While one party will inevitably end
        up the bigger winner, there are benefits to co-opetition and working
        together when targeting source markets or large events.
