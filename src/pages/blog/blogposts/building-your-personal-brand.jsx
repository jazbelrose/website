      <h2>Understand your value.</h2>
      <p>
        Is your value based on your position at a job? To me, it’s based on what
        you’re able to bring to the world, what your talent is and who it serves
        the best. Today’s influencers talk a lot about finding a target audience
        and a niche market. That’s obviously how you attract potential people
        that you can best help. Those people that you would enjoy working with
        the most. But how?
      </p>

      <p>
        Your personal brand speaks for you. Picturing what you want to stand
        for, shapes the opportunities you attract. If you aren’t specific about
        the kind of life you want, or would like to live, people will never know
        for you then the right opportunities won’t come. You have to create a
        proposition that speaks for what you do, and the people you would help
        the most.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Know your worth, know the difference between what you're getting and
        what you deserve.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Show rather than tell</h2>
      <p>
        Going digital opens the door to more opportunities. Create a platform
        where people can see what you do, so that they understand your value,
        that way it becomes easier to sell it. Just showcase your work and let
        it speak for itself. The quality of your digital content is primordial
        today; it should be an essential part of your marketing plan.
        <br />
        <br />
        You won’t make any connection if people don’t know where to find you or
        if your content lacks quality.
      </p>

      <h2>
        You should have the strong desire to rumble and connect people, stretch
        your abilities and explore many different skills.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Understand your value. The salary expectation is usually the thermometer
        of people's self-esteem. They usually end up selling themselves short
        and bring a lot more money to a company than they’re asking for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Always remember that your value lies in the problems of your clients.
        The way you stand is how you can resolve their problems.
      </p>

      <blockquote>Price is what you pay, value is what you get.</blockquote>

      <h2>Update the world on your skills and get reactions.</h2>
      <p>
        If you showcase your work so well that people can’t help talking about
        you, you won’t be the only one talking about your value anymore. Share
        quality content consistently, and get beyond all the opportunities
        you’ve ever had.
